I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise but I had no power to produce it. By degrees after the morning's dawn sleep came. I awoke and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. I listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
