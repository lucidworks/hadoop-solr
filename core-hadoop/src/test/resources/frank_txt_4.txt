Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness I went into the lecturing room which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which I shall never forget: The ancient teachers of this science  said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
